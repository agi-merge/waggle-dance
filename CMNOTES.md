how many licks to the center of a tootsie pop

## Questions

- Could I get a high level overview of what is currently functional
- What are some features I could dig into?
- Trying to understand/debug the double request to api/chain/plan after clicking "start button"
- Trying to understand the returned results into the Log
  - What does review/plan prefix mean
  - What should the user be able to do when they click a task?
- What does the visualizer do for the user?
- What will results hold?
- Does uploading data/referencing a URL do anyhting yet? I don't see it getting sent in the payload to api/chain/plan

## Things I can do

- bit of code review
- small error/type fixes
- refactor chunks into components
- auth only portions?

## TODO

/ trace and review BE code for plan chain
/ re-review docs Jon sent and put in readme

- focus on the cookbook that fucks for a bit
- could refactor component
- research langchain
- pivot to media-grab
-
