# WaggleüêùüíÉDance

## üìñ Overview

Waggle Dance is a Large Language Model (LLM) Agent swarm AGI problem solver that uses a directed acyclic graph concurrent execution model so it can run many LLMs at once, all coordinating to solve a potentially complex problem.

## ü™¶ Use Case Milestones

- TBD
- Converting [x simple library] from [y language] to [z language]
- From my mom lol: "I asked the question: Using viennapres.org website, create an Android app to function as the website does. Got a detailed step by step description of what needed to be done (this definitely eliminates a huge part of business analysts jobs). But I can't do most of what needs to be done!"
- Podcast transcription. Give it the name of the podcast and optionally episode and it just... does it.

## üìÇ Core Files/Folders

- `./packages/db/prisma`: [Database](#database) schema and migrations.
- `./apps/nextjs/src`: Next.js app source code.
- `./apps/nextjs/pages/api`: Next.js API routes.
- `./packages/chain/src`: Model chain business logic and backend services.

## üèÉ How to Run

### Dependencies

- [Node JS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Install

```bash
pnpm i
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the environment variables.

### üêò Primary Database

Prisma adds a layer of abstraction over a database. The database is used as the source-of-truth of the state of an app deployment. E.g. sessions, accounts, any saved chains/results, etc.

Note that this is different than the user's uploaded documents, however it may store metadata about the documents.

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:push
```

- `db:generate` creates the local typings and DB info from the schema.prisma file (`./packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`).
- `db:push` pushes the schema to the database provider (PostgreSQL by default).
- Run these commands on first install and whenever you make changes to the schema.

### Run Development

This is a t3 stack. [You can check the boilerplate documentation](/docs/create-t3-boilerplate.md)

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## üèóÔ∏è CICD

Commits/PRs to the `main` branch will trigger Vercel deploys.

TODO: If desired, figure out a scheme to provide access to vercel builds (not sure if they have a curated/low-access way to do that) and add a helpful link here. Else, keep the keys ot the castle and remove this note.
