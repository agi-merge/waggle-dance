# Main Features

- Highly concurrent execution graph. Some sub-tasks are not dependent, and can be run concurrently.
- Adversarial agents that review results
- [Free Public deployment](https://waggledance.ai)
- Agent data connections, e.g. GitHub, Google Drive, Databases, etc.
- Vector database for long-term memory
- Tools, e.g. Zapier, Web Search, Code-improvement, etc.\*
- Templates and sharing\*

## üìç Roadmap

## ü™¶ Use Case Milestones

As of June 6, 2023, these are not yet achieved.

- Create a statistically likely to be successful Hacker News post title suggestion. Determine the most successful types of Show HN titles in the last three months, with a special focus on AI produts.
- Upload [x format document] report of multi-family housing in the [y metro] area, citing reliable sources and
- Convert [x simple library] from [y language] to [z language]
- Develop and create a pull request for [x feature] to the project at [y git url]

## üõ†Ô∏è Contribute and help

To help the project you can:

- [insert HN, indiehackers, twitter, gh, discord, sponsor].
- If you have technological skills and want to contribute to development, have a look at the open issues. If you are new you can have a look at the good-first-issue and help-wanted labels.
- If you don't have technological skills you can still help improving documentation or add examples or share your user-stories with our community, any help and contribution is welcome!

## üèÉ Running Locally and Developing

Waggle Dance can be deployed using Docker or manually using Node.js. Configuration of `.env` vars is required.

### Docker

`docker-compose build && docker-compose up`

### Dependencies

- [Node JS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- Turbo - `pnpm add turbo --global` or use `npx turbo` in place of `turbo` below.

### Run Development build

```bash
turbo dev
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the environment variables.

### üêò Primary Database

The T3 stack includes Prisma. Currently we are using Postgres. The database is used as the source-of-truth of the state of an app deployment. E.g. sessions, accounts, any saved goals/results, etc.

Note that this is different than the user's uploaded documents, however it may store metadata about the documents.

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:push
```

- `db:generate` creates the local typings and DB info from the schema.prisma file (`./packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`).
- `db:push` pushes the schema to the database provider (PostgreSQL by default).
- Run these commands on first install and whenever you make changes to the schema.

### Run Development

This is a t3 stack. [You can check the boilerplate documentation](/docs/create-t3-boilerplate.md)

```bash
turbo dev
```

## üìÇ Core Files/Folders

- `./packages/db/prisma`: [Database](#database) schema and migrations.
- `./apps/nextjs/src`: Next.js app source code.
- `./apps/nextjs/pages/api`: Next.js API routes.
- `./packages/chain/src`: Model chain business logic and backend services.

## ü¶ë Linting

Make sure you install the recommended extensions in the solution, particularly `es-lint`.

Linting is run on each build and can fail builds.

To get a full list of linting errors run:

```bash
turbo lint
```

Some of these may be able to be auto-fixed with:

```bash
turbo lint:fix
```

for the rest, you will need to open the associated file and fix the errors yourself. Limit `ts-ignore` for extreme cases.

As a best practice, run `turbo lint` before starting a feature and after finishing a feature and fix any errors before sending a `PR`.
