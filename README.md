# WaggleüêùüíÉDance

## üìñ Overview

Waggle Dance is a Large Language Model (LLM) Agent swarm AGI problem solver that uses a directed acyclic graph concurrent execution model so it can run many LLMs at once, all coordinating to solve a potentially complex problem.

## ü™¶ Use Case Milestones

- TBD
- Converting [x simple library] from [y language] to [z language]
- From my mom lol: "I asked the question: Using viennapres.org website, create an Android app to function as the website does. Got a detailed step by step description of what needed to be done (this definitely eliminates a huge part of business analysts jobs). But I can't do most of what needs to be done!"
- Podcast transcription. Give it the name of the podcast and optionally episode and it just... does it.

## üìÇ Core Files/Folders

- `./packages/db/prisma`: [Database](#database) schema and migrations.
- `./apps/nextjs/src`: Next.js app source code.
- `./apps/nextjs/pages/api`: Next.js API routes.
- `./packages/chain/src`: Model chain business logic and backend services.

## Contribute and help

To help the project you can:

- [insert HN, indiehackers, twitter, gh, discord, sponsor].
- If you have technological skills and want to contribute to development, have a look at the open issues. If you are new you can have a look at the good-first-issue and help-wanted labels.
- If you don't have technological skills you can still help improving documentation or add examples or share your user-stories with our community, any help and contribution is welcome!

## üèÉ How to Run

### Dependencies

- [Node JS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Install

```bash
pnpm i
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the environment variables.

### üêò Primary Database

Prisma adds a layer of abstraction over a database. The database is used as the source-of-truth of the state of an app deployment. E.g. sessions, accounts, any saved chains/results, etc.

Note that this is different than the user's uploaded documents, however it may store metadata about the documents.

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:push
```

- `db:generate` creates the local typings and DB info from the schema.prisma file (`./packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`).
- `db:push` pushes the schema to the database provider (PostgreSQL by default).
- Run these commands on first install and whenever you make changes to the schema.

### Run Development

This is a t3 stack. [You can check the boilerplate documentation](/docs/create-t3-boilerplate.md)

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## ü¶ë Linting

Make sure you install the recommended extensions in the solution, particularly `es-lint`.

Linting is run on each build and can fail builds.

To get a full list of linting errors run:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

Some of these may be able to be auto-fixed with:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix
```

for the rest, you will need to open the associated file and fix the errors yourself. Limit `ts-ignore` for extreme cases.

As a best practice, run `pnpm lint` before starting a feature and after finishing a feature and fix any errors before sending a `PR`.

### Side Note

#### Memory Usage

You might find that your `VS Code` editor is running slow and potentially missing linting errors and or saving files slowly. This is likely an indicator that you need to increase the max allowable memory for the `VS Code TS Server`.

Update your workspace settings with something like:

```
"typescript.tsserver.maxTsServerMemory": 6144
```

For example. The default value is 3072.

#### Project Wide Problems

Enable the following in `.vscode/settings.json` in order to get project wide problem analytics outside of running `pnpm lint`:

```
"typescript.tsserver.experimental.enableProjectDiagnostics": true
```

## üèóÔ∏è CICD

Commits/PRs to the `main` branch will trigger Vercel deploys.

TODO: If desired, figure out a scheme to provide access to vercel builds (not sure if they have a curated/low-access way to do that) and add a helpful link here. Else, keep the keys ot the castle and remove this note.
