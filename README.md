**waggledance.ai** is an experimental application focused on achieving user-specified goals. It provides a friendly but opinionated user interface for building agent-based systems. The project focuses on explainability, observability, concurrent generation, and exploration. Currently in pre-alpha, the development philosophy prefers experimentation over stability as goal-solving and Agent systems are rapidly evolving.

waggledance.ai takes a goal and passes it to a **Planner Agent** which streams an execution graph for sub-tasks. Each sub-task is executed as concurrently as possible by **Execution Agents**. To reduce poor results and hallucinations, sub-results are reviewed by **Criticism Agents**. Eventually, the **Human in the loop (you!)** will be able to chat with individual Agents and provide course-corrections if needed.

It was originally inspired by [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT), and has concurrency features similar to those found in [gpt-researcher](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher). Therefore, core tenets of the project include _speed_, _accuracy_, _observability_, and _simplicity_. Additionally, many other agentic systems are written in Python, so this project acts as a small counter-balance, and is accessible to the large number of Javascript developers.

An (unstable) API is also available via [tRPC](packages/api/src/root.ts) as well an API [implemented within Next.js](apps/nextjs/src/pages/api). The client-side is mostly responsible for orchestrating and rendering the agent executions, while the API and server-side executes the agents and stores the results. This architecture is likely to be adjusted in the future.

# ü¶ö Highlighted Features

- LLMs go brrr‚Ä¶ waggledance.ai starts by planning a highly concurrent execution graph. Some sub-task branches are not dependent, and can run concurrently.
- Adversarial agents that review results.
- Vector database for long-term memory.
- Explainable results and responsive UI: Graph visualizer, sub-task (agent) results, agent logs and events.

Basically, anything and everything goes! Though [multi-agent systems have a long and storied past](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/multi-agent-systems), this project is all about marrying the past techniques with the latest research.

## üèÉ Running Locally and Development

~~waggledance.ai can be deployed using Docker or manually using Node.js. Configuration of `.env` vars is required.~~
Docker support is coming soon.

### Docker (coming soon)

`docker-compose build && docker-compose up`

### Dependencies

- Required: [Node JS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en) ‚âß v18.17.0 (LTS recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) is used in examples but `npm` or `yarn` may work as well.
- Recommended: Turbo - `pnpm add turbo --global` or use `pnpx turbo` in place of `turbo` below.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Your Environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the environment variables. For help, please [reach out on Discord](https://discord.gg/ttt9YmhQU6). See [env.mjs](https://github.com/agi-merge/waggle-dance/blob/main/apps/nextjs/src/env.mjs) for explicit requirements.

### üêò Setting up Postgres

Refer to [.env.example](https://github.com/agi-merge/waggle-dance/tree/main/.env.example) and [env.mjs](https://github.com/agi-merge/waggle-dance/tree/main/apps/nextjs/env.mjs) for the required environment variables.
Currently only Postgres via Prisma is supported. You can use a local Postgres instance (it is recommended to use Docker) or a cloud provider such as [Supabase](https://supabase.com).

Once you have set up, secured, and configured your Postgres, run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:push
```

- `db:generate` creates the local typings and DB info from the schema.prisma file (`./packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`).
- `db:push` pushes the schema to the database provider (PostgreSQL by default).
- Run these commands on first install and whenever you make changes to the schema.

### Run Development

```bash
turbo dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

This project was forked from [create-t3-turbo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo) [To find out more, you can check the boilerplate documentation](/docs/t3-boilerplate.md)

## ü¶ë Linting

Make sure you install the recommended extensions in the solution, particularly `es-lint`.

Linting is run on each build and can fail builds.

To get a full list of linting errors run:

```bash
turbo lint
```

Some of these may be able to be auto-fixed with:

```bash
turbo lint:fix
```

And the version that the CI runs:

```bash
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true NODE_ENV=production  turbo build
```

For the rest, you will need to open the associated file and fix the errors yourself. Limit `ts-ignore` for extreme cases.

As a best practice, run `turbo lint` before starting a feature and after finishing a feature and fix any errors before sending a `PR`.
