**Waggle Dance** is a _highly experimental‚Ñ¢Ô∏è_ adversarial-cooperative multi-agent goal solver, currently powered by [Langchain.js](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs).

Waggle Dance takes a goal and passes it to a Planner Agent which streams an execution graph for sub-tasks. Each sub-task is executed as concurrently as possible by Execution Agents. To reduce poor results and hallucinations, sub-results are reviewed by Criticism Agents. Eventually, the Human in the loop (you!) will be able to chat with individual Agents, and provide course-corrections if needed.

It is inspired by [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT), and has a lot in common with [gpt-researcher](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher).

# Highlighted Features

- Highly concurrent execution graph. Some sub-task branches are not dependent, and can run concurrently.
- Adversarial agents that review results.
- Vector database for long-term memory.
- Explainable UI: Graph visualizer, sub-task (agent) results, agent logs and events.

## üìç Roadmap

[Project Roadmap Board](https://github.com/orgs/agi-merge/projects/1/views/1)

- Agent data connections, e.g. GitHub, Google Drive, Databases, etc.
- Local LLMs / removing strict dependence on OpenAI
- Tree of thought and other execution methods
- Desktop and mobile apps
- Migrate to from Next.js Pages structure to App structure
- Consider removing langchain
- Improved architecture for running agents
- More tools
- More data connectors
- Templates and sharing
- See more:

## üèÉ Running Locally and Development

Waggle Dance can be deployed using Docker or manually using Node.js. Configuration of `.env` vars is required.

### Docker

`docker-compose build && docker-compose up`

### Dependencies

- [Node JS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- Turbo - `pnpm add turbo --global` or use `npx turbo` in place of `turbo` below.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the environment variables.

### üêò Primary Database

The T3 stack includes Prisma. Currently we are using Postgres. The database is used as the source-of-truth of the state of an app deployment. E.g. sessions, accounts, any saved goals/results, etc.

Note that this is different than the user's uploaded documents, however it may store metadata about the documents.

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:push
```

- `db:generate` creates the local typings and DB info from the schema.prisma file (`./packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`).
- `db:push` pushes the schema to the database provider (PostgreSQL by default).
- Run these commands on first install and whenever you make changes to the schema.

### Run Development

This is a T3 stack. [You can check the boilerplate documentation](/docs/create-t3-boilerplate.md)

```bash
turbo dev
```

## ü¶ë Linting

Make sure you install the recommended extensions in the solution, particularly `es-lint`.

Linting is run on each build and can fail builds.

To get a full list of linting errors run:

```bash
turbo lint
```

Some of these may be able to be auto-fixed with:

```bash
turbo lint:fix
```

for the rest, you will need to open the associated file and fix the errors yourself. Limit `ts-ignore` for extreme cases.

As a best practice, run `turbo lint` before starting a feature and after finishing a feature and fix any errors before sending a `PR`.
