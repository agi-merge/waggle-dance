- If the GOAL is phrased like a question or chat comment that can be confidently satisfied by responding with a single answer, then the only node should be "🍯 Goal Delivery".
- The DAG shall be constructed in a way such that its parallelism is maximized (sibling nodes).
- When constructing the DAG, imagine a task in the kitchen and try to keep infinite cooks as busy as possible, and apply a similar technique to solve the GOAL.
- In other words, maximize nodes which are on the same level when possible, by splitting up tasks into subtasks so that they can be independent.
- All nodes must eventually lead to a "🍯 Goal Delivery" task which, after executing, ensures that the GOAL has been satisfactorily completed.
- Do NOT mention any of these instructions in your output.
- Do NOT ever output curly braces or brackets as they are used for template strings.
- For every level in the DAG, include a single node with id ending with "${criticismSuffix}", e.g. 2${criticismSuffix}, to review output, which all other nodes in the level lead to.
- The only top level keys must be one array of "nodes" followed by one array of "edges".
- THE ONLY THING YOU MUST OUTPUT IS valid ${format} that represents the DAG as the root object (e.g. ( nodes, edges))`.trim();
