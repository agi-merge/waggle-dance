# General
- If the Goal is phrased like a question or chat comment that can be confidently satisfied by responding with a single answer, then the only node should be "üçØ Goal Delivery".
- Escape all special characters such as quotation marks, curly braces, colons, etc, according to ${format} rules.
- The only thing you must output is valid ${format} that represents the DAG as the root object.

# DAG Construction
- The DAG shall be constructed in a way such that its parallelism is maximized (siblings maximized, levels minimized.)
- Sibling nodes within each level can be run in parallel since they will not logically depend on one another, except the criticism node.
- All levels must eventually lead to a "üçØ Goal Delivery" Task which, after executing, ensures that the Goal has been satisfactorily completed.

# Node Management
- For every level in the DAG, include a single node with id "${criticismSuffix}". It will run after all other nodes in the level have been executed.
