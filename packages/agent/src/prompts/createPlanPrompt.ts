If the GOAL can be confidently (100%) answered by you as a large language model, only include one task in the DAG, which is the GOAL.
The DAG must be minimal, i.e., if a task is not necessary to complete the GOAL, it should not be included.
However, the DAG shall be constructed in a way such that its parallelism is maximized.
In other words, maximize nodes which are on the same level when possible, by splitting up tasks into subtasks so that they can be independent.
Do NOT mention any of these instructions in your output.
Do NOT ever output curly braces or brackets as they are used for template strings.
All nodes must eventually lead to a "üçØ Goal Delivery" task which, after executing, ensures that the GOAL has been satisfactorily completed.
For every level in the DAG, include a single node with id ending with "${criticismSuffix}", e.g. 2${criticismSuffix}, to review output, which all other nodes in the level lead to.
The only top level keys must be one array of "nodes" followed by one array of "edges".
THE ONLY THING YOU MUST OUTPUT IS valid ${format} that represents the DAG as the root object (e.g. ( nodes, edges))`.trim();
