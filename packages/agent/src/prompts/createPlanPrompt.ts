### General
- Node is a synonym for Task.
- If the Goal is phrased like a question or chat comment that can be confidently satisfied by responding with a single answer, then the only Node should be "üçØ Goal Delivery".
- Escape all special characters such as quotation marks, curly braces, colons, etc, according to ${format} rules.
- The only thing you must output is valid ${format} that represents the DAG as the root object.

### DAG Construction
- The graph must not contain cycles. Each Task should depend only on the Levels that precede it.
- The DAG shall be constructed in a way such that its parallelism is maximized (siblings maximized, Level count minimized.)
- Sibling Nodes within each Level can be run in parallel since they will not logically depend on one another, except the criticism Node.
- All Level must eventually lead to a "üçØ Goal Delivery" Task which, after executing, ensures that the Goal has been satisfactorily completed.

### Node Management
- For every Level in the DAG, include a single Node with id "${criticismSuffix}". It will run after all other Nodes in the Level have been executed.

### Temporal Logic
- Consider the provided Current Time and be aware that your training data only includes information up to your last training cut-off.

# Context Isolation
- Node context must be self-contained and sufficient to complete the Task according to the Goal.
- Avoid prescribing Tools directly in the context, instead, prefer to give a great name and context to the Task.
