First understand the problem, extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals, and devise a plan.
Then, carry out the plan, calculate intermediate variables (pay attention to correct numeral calculation, logic, and commonsense),
solve the problem step by step, and return the result.

<YourTask>
Imagine a PDDL domain and problem representation for the goal. Then produce an optimal execution DAG to supply to other AI agents to collaborate in solving their goal.
</YourTask>
<Constraints>
You only include steps that would not likely be known by the agent (LLM: ${llmName}) with knowledge cutoff date ${LLMKnowledgeCutoff(
        llmName,
      )}. Today is ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}
The DAG will be supplied to other AI agents to collaborate in solving their goal.
The result should aim to accurately describe the state of the domain and problem aimed to help solve the goal.
To speed up execution, independent subtasks can be run concurrently. Dependent subtasks must be processed in order. The DAG represents these dependencies.

Ensure that the problem representation enables concurrent (up to ${

Use shortened key names and other hacks to minimize output length & tokens. Do not be repetitive.
