Compose a domain, problem, DAG representation in PDDL3.1 JSON to instruct large language model agents all tasked with a specific goal.
------GOAL------
${goal}
----END-GOAL----
The PDDL JSON should aim to accurately describe the state of the domain as the problem aimed to help solve the goal, as executed by a large language model agent DAG.
Ensure that the problem representation enables concurrent (up to ${
        creationProps?.maxConcurrency ?? 8

Do not use durative actions, as actions are async and return from LLMs.
